# Bank transactions API testing program
> This project is a program which allows users to test an endpoint for Bank transactions.

## Objectives

- Create an account https://www.mockapi.io/projects and set up an endpoint for Bank transactions (all
information embedded in same API, i.e., only 1 endpoint required).

- Structure the project making the requests reusable, avoid to repeat code or the endpoints, use TestNG
and create a Readme.md with the specifications and steps to run the exercise and add a gitignore.

- For every request please make sure to include at least an assertion for the Status Code (Use POJOs to
manage response data not just the body). Please make sure you use JavaDoc.

- Create the following tests using the the Bank transactions endpoint:

  - @Test 1 > Verify the Endpoint is empty (If it has any data use the DELETE request to clean and
  leave it empty)
  - @Test 2 > Initialize the POJO with 10 random data (Use the minimal Requirements). Also, make
  a code verification for avoiding duplicate email accounts. Then, perform the POST request.
  - @Test 3 > Make the GET request, asserting that there are not duplicate email accounts.
  - @Test 4 > Add a test to update an existing AccountNumber

### API Endpoint

This is the available endpoint for this project.

https://mockapi.io/projects/637d966d9c2635df8f89fa86

## Installation

1. Clone this repository

```
Open IntelliJ -> Select Git -> Select Clone... -> Select URL and enter "https://github.com/jcgonzalezb/API_Testing_Bank_Transactions_Final" -> Click on Clone.
```

After this, the program is ready to run.

## Usage

1. Once the program is installed, find the suite.xml file, make right-click on this file and select "Run suite.xml".
2. The tests inside the suite.xml will run and the results of the tests will be shown. 

Here is an example of the test results.
```
Getting all transactions from the endpoint...
Amount of transactions on the endpoint: 10 transactions.
Deleting all transactions from the endpoint...
Amount of transactions on the endpoint: 0 transactions.
The endpoint is empty.
Test: verifyEndpointIsEmpty [PASSED]
Initializing the POJO and creating ten transactions using random data.
Checking new transactions, looking for duplicate emails.
Sending the ten transactions to the endpoint...
All ten transactions were created on the endpoint.
Test: createRandomTransactionsTest [PASSED]
Getting all transactions from the endpoint...
Amount of transactions on the endpoint: 10 transactions.
Checking all transactions from the endpoint looking for duplicate emails
All transactions have different emails. No duplicated emails were found.
Test: getTransactionsTest [PASSED]
Getting all transactions from the endpoint...
Amount of transactions on the endpoint: 10 transactions.
The transaction with Account Number 848225 will be updated.
The Account Number 848225 was replaced by the new account number 149474.
A transaction was updated using an existing account number.
Test: updateAccountNumberTest [PASSED]
